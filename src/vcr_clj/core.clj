                  arguments. During recording/playback, the original

                  transformer, and the transformed arguments are passed
                  to arg-key-fn, recordable? and the recorded function.
                  Defaults to clojure.core/vector.
     :arg-key-fn  a function of the same arguments as the var that is
                  expected to return a value that can be stored and
                  compared for equality to the expected call. Defaults
                  to clojure.core/vector.
     :recordable? a predicate with the same arg signature as the var.
                  If the predicate returns false/nil on any call, the
                  call will be passed through transparently to the
                  original function without recording/playback.
     :return-transformer
                  a function that the return value will be passed through
                  while recording, which can be useful for doing things
                  like ensuring serializability.
